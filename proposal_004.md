title: Proposal 4 â€” A Programming Keyboard/Computer
---

It's clear to me that the iPhone/iPad model of computer is here to
stay and is what *most* people use as a computer. Programmers on the
other hand need something more. There's disconnect between the
computers we use while programming and the computers we use the rest
of the time. We carry around two or three sets of screen, cpu, and
batteries. Could we supplement, say, an iPad with a keyboard and some
other connections for hooking up whatever it is that we always seem to
want to hook up to our computers?

What I want is something that has the same form factor of an 80s home
computer. It will be a keyboard with a built-in cpu, memory, storage,
SD card, and USB ports. Instead of a monitor we use an iOS device and
an app that receives commands and input from the keyboard-computer.
