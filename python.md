## Functional Programming

* [fn.py](https://github.com/kachayev/fn.py) - Nice set of tools, but
  documentation is sparse. The lambda as an _ is particularly nice,
  especially if I rename it to Î» and I can figure out how to do a
  little more complex things with it. There are also Persistent data
  structures which look interesting, itertools helpers, and much more.
* [PyToolz](http://toolz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - More
  tools to extend functools, itertools, and dictionaries. I need to
  read the docs as they provide context and explanations.
