title: Single Board Computers
---

It makes sense to start playing around with existing single board
computers in order to learn how to get a minimal operating system up
and running. I'm going to try to avoid x86 (I think). Raspberry Pi
is well documented, cheap but capable, and should demonstrate that
one doesn't need the latest fasted CPUs to make a snappy UI.

The
[Raspberry Pi Bare Metal Forum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=72)
and the associated
[bare metal resources topic](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=72&t=72260)
are a great place to start.

* [bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial) -
  Good notes with pointers to other tutorials for learning other stuff
  like USB and OpenGL.
* [Ultibo](https://ultibo.org/make/) - Unikernel written is Pascal
  with a lot of good stuff. Maybe the start of Project Oberon for the
  Pi? Hmm... Lots of good docs on how stuff was done and links to
  hardware docs.
* [rsta2/circle](https://github.com/rsta2/circle) - A C++ bare metal
  environment with USB.
* [VisUAL](https://salmanarif.bitbucket.io/visual/index.html) - Nice
  looking stepping emulator for ARM.
* [Lesson 6 Screen01](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/screen01.html) - How to draw pixels on the screen
