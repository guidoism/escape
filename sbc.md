title: Single Board Computers

It makes sense to start playing around with existing single board
computers in order to learn how to get a minimal operating system up
and running. I'm going to try to avoid x86 (I think). Raspberry Pi
is well documented, cheap but capable, and should demonstrate that
one doesn't need the latest fasted CPUs to make a snappy UI.
