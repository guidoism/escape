I'm going to attempt to be more open about my progress, maybe not quite as radically open as [Steve Krouse](https://futureofcoding.org/log) but I will try to provide a summary of my progress, insights, readings, and todos. I think this will be especially good to help me construct a narrative for myself and congeal
some of my thinking. It will also be a good place to put my bazzilion open tabs
that haven't yet be consumed enough for my to write in my physical notebook.

I spent a good part of the summer playing around with the lowest level of
computing: Keyboard switches, soldering irons, 7400 series logic chips, Verilog, and FPGAs. My goal was to create a Planck-like keyboard that used an FPGA and a matrix scanner written in Verilog as the base for a computer that uses no existing microcontrollers or cpus. I started with 3 4x4 top-plate PCBs that were
designed by the guy from [40% Keyboards](http://www.40percent.club/2018/01/4x4x4x4x4.html). I uploaded the files to a PCB
manufacturer and ordered the parts. It was a new experience for me. I then super-glued 3 of them together, installed some
off-brand cherry brown keyboard switches and soldered the matrix together with diodes and wires. I tested it with LEDs and
the switches worked great. The next step was the FPGA and Verilog. My [ICE40 FPGA board](https://www.nandland.com) didn't have enough available inputs
and outputs for all of the rows and columns so I built a multiplexer with 7400 parts. That was quite a learning experience
too. I'd never done anything like this. I ended with somewhat of a working system, but like many of my projects I got interested in other things and put this off to the side while I investigated those other things.

## How we interact with the display

One of the parts of computing which I very much dislike is just about everything
around the world of writing stuff to the screen. I hate html and css, my naive
attempts at understanding opengl made me feel like an idiot. I hate that computers
have jank when updating displays and feel much more laggy than the computers I used
as a child in the 1980s. 

i can feel the lag, maybe its just placebo, but i feel it, i want keystroke to display update to happen
faster than the frame refresh of a 120hz display which is currently considered fast enough for smooth
scrolling. also, makes me think why the hell do we even need to scan, cant we just talk to those pixels
themselves and say, hey, update and become part of the letter 'G'.

Besides lagginess I want an easier way to make beautiful stuff on the screen. People make the most beautiful
stuff with TeX, Metapost, and Postscript so I figure that I should start there. There exists Display Postscript
made for putting stuff on a screen instead of paper but I haven't yet found much about it. Instead I'm spending
my time learning Postscript. There exists only one interactive postscript app (for the Mac) that updates the
display based on what you write. It's kind of crazy to me how few tools there are for this. But I also found
[WPS](http://logand.com/sw/wps/index.html) which converts Postscript to HTML Canvas commands and 
[PostCanvas](http://www.feiri.de/pcan/), but neither of them do exactly what I want and aren't complete and
since I'm doing this to learn I might as well right my own, so that's what I did. Well, to a point.
