I'm going to attempt to be more open about my progress, maybe not quite as radically
open as [Steve Krouse](https://futureofcoding.org/log) but I will try to provide a 
summary of my progress, insights, readings, and todos. I think this
will be especially good to help me construct a narrative for myself and congeal
some of my thinking. It will also be a good place to put my bazzilion open tabs
that haven't yet be consumed enough for my to write in my physical notebook.
