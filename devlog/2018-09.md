I'm going to attempt to be more open about my progress, maybe not quite as radically open as [Steve Krouse](https://futureofcoding.org/log) but I will try to provide a summary of my progress, insights, readings, and todos. I think this will be especially good to help me construct a narrative for myself and congeal
some of my thinking. It will also be a good place to put my bazzilion open tabs
that haven't yet be consumed enough for my to write in my physical notebook.

I spent a good part of the summer playing around with the lowest level of
computing: Keyboard switches, soldering irons, 7400 series logic chips, Verilog, and FPGAs. My goal was to create a Planck-like keyboard that used an FPGA and a matrix scanner written in Verilog as the base for a computer that uses no existing microcontrollers or cpus. I started with 3 4x4 top-plate PCBs that were
designed by the guy from [40% Keyboards](http://www.40percent.club/2018/01/4x4x4x4x4.html). I uploaded the files to a PCB
manufacturer and ordered the parts. It was a new experience for me.
