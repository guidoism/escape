[Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) is a cross-platform graphics library that
is simpler to use than the GL-style stuff. It works on all the platforms including
iOS and WebGL so it might be good to use as interface that takes DVI commands. 

[Slug](http://sluglibrary.com) is another library to try out.
