title: Plan of Study
---

I'm am ignorant of a lot of the issues. This is my plan of study.
Well... It's more of a dumping ground for stuff I'd like to eventually
look at.

## Math

* [Graphical Lineral Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net) -
  Found it because they talk about using intersecting strings as
  notation and I was looking around at a better notation for stack
  manipulations in Forth.

## Programming Languages

* [Stack Quarks](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/%7Erc/Timbre/ContentPages/Timbre/SQP/StackQuarksPaper.html) - The fundamental operations on a stack are like quarks in physics in that there's nothing smaller. This paper describes those stack operations.
* [Rob Chapman's papers](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/~rc/Papers/) -
  The rest of the papers by the guy who wrote the Stack Quarks papers.
  He works at GreenArrays so he probably knows what he's talking about.
* [Marcel Hendrix's Forth Links](http://home.vianetworks.nl/users/mhx/) -
  A bunch of links to Forth and stack computer websites and papers.

## Graphic Design

* [Math markup in TeX Quick Reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) - 
  A Math Stack Exchange question with a bunch of crowd-sourced
  notations. Better than anything Knuth has done. Can use the
  [MathJax Demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo) to try stuff out quickly.
* [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html) - *The
  Programmers Solid **3D** **CAD** Modeller* written by the same guy who
  reverse-engineered an FPGA format and wrote the only full-stack of
  open source FPGA development tools. The method of input is code
  rather than clicking on buttons so I should be able to learn
  something about how to do something similar on a **2D** surface. Also,
  it just looks really cool.

## Existing UI Toolkits

* [pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/programming_guide/quickstart.html#hello-world) - 
  Python toolkit for drawing stuff on the screen and handling keyboard
  events, looks pretty easy to use. The nice thing about it which
  seperates it from the others is that it requires no external
  dependenies. Might be a good place to start experimenting.

## CPUs

* [Chatchawit Aportenwan's Stack **CPU** Simulator](http://pioneer.netserv.chula.ac.th/~achatcha/2301274/Simulator_Orig.html) - 
  4 bit, works in a webpage, easy to use and understand. Worth using
  this as a model for my own simulator.
