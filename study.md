title: Plan of Study
---

I'm am ignorant of a lot of the issues. This is my plan of study.
Well... It's more of a dumping ground for stuff I'd like to eventually
look at.

## Math

* [Graphical Lineral Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net) -
  Found it because they talk about using intersecting strings as
  notation and I was looking around at a better notation for stack
  manipulations in Forth.

## Programming Languages

* [Stack Quarks](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/%7Erc/Timbre/ContentPages/Timbre/SQP/StackQuarksPaper.html) - The fundamental operations on a stack are like quarks in physics in that there's nothing smaller. This paper describes those stack operations.
* [Rob Chapman's papers](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/~rc/Papers/) -
  The rest of the papers by the guy who wrote the Stack Quarks papers.
  He works at GreenArrays so he probably knows what he's talking about.
* [Marcel Hendrix's Forth Links](http://home.vianetworks.nl/users/mhx/) -
  A bunch of links to Forth and stack computer websites and papers.

## Graphic Design

* [Math markup in TeX Quick Reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) - 
  A Math Stack Exchange question with a bunch of crowd-sourced
  notations. Better than anything Knuth has done. Can use the
  [MathJax Demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo) to try stuff out quickly.
