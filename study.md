I'm am ignorant of a lot of the issues. This is my plan of study.
Well... It's more of a dumping ground for stuff I'd like to eventually
look at.

## General

* [Papers we Love](http://paperswelove.org) - *a repository of
  academic computer science papers and a community who loves reading
  them.* There are a bazzilion papers I need to look at from here and
  this is a place I should check back regularly.
* [Shtetl-Optimized](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/) - Found this
  because of his review of *Gödel, Escher, Bach*. A whole lot of great
  articles about computer science, science, etc going back to 2005.
  His blogroll is great (I miss blogrolls).
* [ASPLOS Procedings](https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE178) - Lots of
  papers focusing on the interaction between architecture, programming
  langauges, and operating systems.
* [Min-Move 2017](http://insight-archlab.github.io/minmove17.html) -
  Workshoping focusing on the minimization of data movement.
* [Computational Thinking Papers](http://people.cs.vt.edu/~kafura/CS6604/Papers.html)
* [Programming, Made Complicated](https://programmingmadecomplicated.wordpress.com)
* [ACM Microarchitecture Conference](https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE203)

## Math

* [Graphical Lineral Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net) -
  Found it because they talk about using intersecting strings as
  notation and I was looking around at a better notation for stack
  manipulations in Forth.

## Programming Languages

* [Stack Quarks](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/%7Erc/Timbre/ContentPages/Timbre/SQP/StackQuarksPaper.html) - The fundamental operations on a stack are like quarks in physics in that there's nothing smaller. This paper describes those stack operations.
* [Rob Chapman's papers](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/~rc/Papers/) -
  The rest of the papers by the guy who wrote the Stack Quarks papers.
  He works at GreenArrays so he probably knows what he's talking about.
* [Marcel Hendrix's Forth Links](http://home.vianetworks.nl/users/mhx/) -
  A bunch of links to Forth and stack computer websites and papers.
* [The Most Beautiful Program Ever Written](http://paperswelove.org/2017/video/will-byrd-most-beautiful-program/) - 
  Talk about meta-circular interpreters. Link includes a bunch of
  links to interesting references from the talk.
* [5 - A Stack-based Array Langauge](http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10500710) -
  Sort of a mix between Forth and **APL**.
* [William Byrd's website](http://webyrd.net) - Guy who wrote The
  Reasoned Schemer, lots of links to papers and research in
  programming languages and logic theory.
* [End-user Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_development) -
  Wikipedia page about a programming paradigm where end-users are able
  to write their own programs (for example with spreadsheets). The
  side link box on the pages has a bunch of links to other programmig
  paradigms that are worth looking at. I hadn't heard of a bunch of
  them.
* [Almost Perfect Artifacts Improve only in Small Ways: APL is more French than English](http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/perlis78.htm) - Perlis paper
* [In Praise of APL: A Language for Lyrical Programming](http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/perlis77.htm) - Another Perlis paper
* [Montalbano's Personal History of Apl](http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/APL-hist.html)
* [Perlis's Epigrams in Programming](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/perlis-alan/quotes.html) -
   A bunch of quotes we may have heard before but didn't know where
   they came from.
* [HolonForth](http://www.holonforth.com/index.html) - Wolf Wejgaard's
  Forth editor that acts as a browser for parts of the program rather
  than files. He has several papers about this form of programming on
  this website. The term *holon* comes from Arthur Koestler's book
  *The Ghost in the Machine* and refers to having stable intermediate
  forms that can be used to build larger forms. I need to read all of
  the pages on that website.
* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) - Newish small language similar to
  Python and Pascal.
* [Pixie](https://github.com/pixie-lang/pixie) - Lisp written in
  rpython with jit and stuff written in pixie itself.
* [Practical Foundations for Programming Languages](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/pfpl/2nded.pdf) - Similar to SICP. The [author's blog](https://existentialtype.wordpress.com) and [discussion about the book](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/08/practical-foundations-for-programming-languages/)
* [The memory models that underlie programming languages](http://canonical.org/~kragen/memory-models/) - Describes different ways of thinking about memory and the benefits of each
* [Constraint Logic Propagation Conflict Spreadsheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voG5-15aDu4) - Video, need to watch
* [To Dissect a Mockingbird](http://dkeenan.com/Lambda/index.htm) - A Graphical Notation for the Lambda Calculus with Animated Reduction
* [Notes on notation and thought](https://github.com/hypotext/notation/blob/master/README.md)
* [The Theory of Concatenative Combinators](http://tunes.org/~iepos/joy.html) - The eight combinators swap, dup, zap, cat, cons, unit, i, and dip can be used to construct all others. Good article describing theory from Joy
* [Linear Logic and Permutation Stacks--The Forth Shall Be First](http://home.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ForthStack.html) - THE "FORTRAN FALLACY" and "pseudo-mathematical notation and a von Neumann-style random access memory"

## Graphic Design

* [Math markup in TeX Quick Reference](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference) - 
  A Math Stack Exchange question with a bunch of crowd-sourced
  notations. Better than anything Knuth has done. Can use the
  [MathJax Demo](https://www.mathjax.org/#demo) to try stuff out quickly.
* [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/documentation.html) - *The
  Programmers Solid **3D** **CAD** Modeller* written by the same guy who
  reverse-engineered an FPGA format and wrote the only full-stack of
  open source FPGA development tools. The method of input is code
  rather than clicking on buttons so I should be able to learn
  something about how to do something similar on a **2D** surface. Also,
  it just looks really cool.
* [Metapost](http://tug.org/metapost.html) looks like a better tool than raw Postscript for doing display figures.
  [Lots of examples](http://tex.loria.fr/prod-graph/zoonekynd/metapost/metapost.html)
* [Scholarly Markdown on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9204352) - Also https://www.peterkrautzberger.org/0172/
  and http://aig.cs.man.ac.uk/people/srp/
* [ΕΥΚΛΕΙΔΗΣ](http://www.eukleides.org) - A Geometry Drawing Language
* [Visual History of EVE](http://futureofcoding.org/essays/eve/)

## Existing UI Toolkits

* [pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/pyglet-1.3-maintenance/programming_guide/quickstart.html#hello-world) - 
  Python toolkit for drawing stuff on the screen and handling keyboard
  events, looks pretty easy to use. The nice thing about it which
  seperates it from the others is that it requires no external
  dependenies. Might be a good place to start experimenting.

## CPUs

* [Chatchawit Aportenwan's Stack **CPU** Simulator](http://pioneer.netserv.chula.ac.th/~achatcha/2301274/Simulator_Orig.html) - 
  4 bit, works in a webpage, easy to use and understand. Worth using
  this as a model for my own simulator.
* [Ricardo Gutierrez-Osuna's Microprocessor-based system design class notes](http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/rgutier/ceg411_f01/) - 
  **PDF** lecture slides are really good. Worth reading through them.
  Also worth looking around his site to see if there's anything else
  similar for other classes he's done.
* [freecomputerbooks.com Architecture books](http://freecomputerbooks.com/compscArchitectureBooks.html)
* [H2 Stack CPU + Graphical Simulator](https://github.com/howerj/forth-cpu) -
  Very nicely done simulator. Need to play with this more.
*
  [Koopman's RTX2000 Simulator](https://github.com/mschuldt/rtx2000_simulator) -
  Ported to Linux and running AppForth.
* [GA144 Simulator](https://github.com/mschuldt/ga144) - and
  [tools](https://github.com/jamesbowman/ga144tools)
* [SECD: A high level description](https://dmytrish.wordpress.com/2013/08/09/secd-part-i/) - Nice and simple description
* [One-Page CPUs](https://revaldinho.github.io/opc/) - Several cpu designs that all fit on a page. They build upon each other.
* [AnyCPU](http://anycpu.org/forum/index.php) - Forums where people discuss designs of various CPUs.
* [ZipCPU](http://zipcpu.com) - Blog about designing CPUs for FPGAs.
* [CPUSim](http://www.cs.colby.edu/djskrien/CPUSim/) - Microcode level simulator written in Java for classroom instruction.
* [Wireworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld) - Kind of game of life but which can be used to do calculations.
* [Reverse engineering the ARM1](http://www.righto.com/2015/12/reverse-engineering-arm1-ancestor-of.html) - Very good description of the [amazing animation](http://visual6502.org/sim/varm/armgl.html) of a working ARM1 CPU. Worth studying. Also, the simulation uses the [ChipSim Javascript Simulator](http://visual6502.org/wiki/index.php?title=The_ChipSim_Simulator) which should be relatively easy to use to visualize our own designs and should be especially interesting during our education.
* [Conway's VLSI Archive](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/conway/VLSI/VLSIarchive.mainlinks.html) - Lots of documents from the VSLI revolution of the late 70's
* [CMOS VLSI Design](https://www.amazon.com/CMOS-VLSI-Design-Circuits-Perspective/dp/0321547748) - Excellent book for the software engineer trying to understand the way computers work at the transistor level.
