title: Plan of Study
---

I'm am ignorant of a lot of the issues. This is my plan of study.

## Math

* [Graphical Lineral Algebra](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net) -
  Found it because they talk about using intersecting strings as
  notation and I was looking around at a better notation for stack
  manipulations in Forth.

## Programming Languages

* [Stack Quarks](http://clubweb.interbaun.com/%7Erc/Timbre/ContentPages/Timbre/SQP/StackQuarksPaper.html) - The fundamental operations on a stack are like quarks in physics in that there's nothing smaller. This paper describes those stack operations.
