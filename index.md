The current *state of the art* in computing with our superscaler pipelined, speculatively executed, multi-level cached, multi-core cpus using closed-source BIOS running operating systems built upon layers and layers of ancient buggy code written in ancient programmer-hostle languages with its model based on physical desk and its fetish-like desire to be general purpose while focusing on the the performance of arithmetic rather than human interaction is a local maximum. Indeed, many local maxima. Let us work together to break free of these and invent the future of computing.

### Let's speculate and describe our wishes and dreams

* A computer should be personal but not scary to share
* A computer should be usable from multiple screens and form factors
* A computer should enable multiple contexts without causing confusion
* A computer should be pleasant to use and should be aesthetically pleasing to the eye and touch
* A computer should not need to be babied, one should never need to think about charging batteries or updating
* A computer should never prioritize novelty over usabilty or stability
* A computer should be trusted
* A computer should be provide the world's best form of reading
* A computer should be understandable -- Any normal curious person should be able to start with the highest level abstractions and figure out how it works on their own
* A computer should be programmable -- Everything should be available for hacking (with appropriate warnings and guards and training wheels)
* A computer shouldn't lose data

### Areas of new research

* Quit doing stuff over and over again on battery-constrained devices. How many cpu cycles are wasted, how many pounds of CO2 are emitted, in order to display static text on a phone? The website is probably generating html over and over again. The phone is parsing that html over and over again and converting it to glyphs positioned in the same place on the same device type over and over again. And all of this shitty typography!
* Quit doing work on battery-constrained devices that could be safely done on an non-mobile device. Under normal circumstances battery-constrained devices should do as little computation as possible. If latency requirements can be satisfied we should move the work onto a server, whether owned by the user or not.
