The current *state of the art* in computing with our superscaler pipelined, speculatively executed, multi-level cached, multi-core cpus using closed-source BIOS running operating systems built upon layers and layers of ancient buggy code written in ancient programmer-hostle languages with its model based on physical desk and its fetish-like desire to be general purpose while focusing on the the performance of arithmetic rather than human interaction is a local maximum. Indeed, many local maxima. Let us work together to break free of these and invent the future of computing.

### Let's speculate and describe our wishes and dreams

* A computer should be personal but not scary to share
* A computer should be usable from multiple screens and form factors
* A computer should enable multiple contexts without causing confusion
* A computer should be pleasant to use and should be aesthetically pleasing to the eye and touch
* A computer should not need to be babied, one should never need to think about charging batteries or updating
* A computer should never prioritize novelty over usabilty or stability
* A computer should be trusted
* A computer should be provide the world's best form of reading
