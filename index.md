The current *state of the art* in computing with our superscaler pipelined, speculatively executed, multi-level cached, multi-core cpus using closed-source BIOS running operating systems built upon layers and layers of ancient buggy code written in ancient programmer-hostle languages with its model based on physical desk and its fetish-like desire to be general purpose while focusing on the the performance of arithmetic rather than human interaction is a local maximum. Indeed, many local maxima. Let us work together to break free of these and invent the future of computing.
