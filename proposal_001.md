title: Proposal 1
---

In this document I will describe what I imagine what one of these
computers might look like.

The **CPU** is a 32 bit stack machine. We choose a stack machine
because we want to prioritize code density, to use Forth as the
assembly language, and want the **CPU** to use as few transistors as
possible. We choose a 32 bit word length because we want our computer
to use less than 4 billion words of **RAM**.

We also choose to index **RAM** by words rather than bytes since we
will generally operate on entire words.

The computer also makes heavy use of **ROM** to store library
functions. This **ROM** will be accessed just like **RAM** but
it will be denser than the equivilent amount of **RAM** and consume
less power. We will prepopulate it with a plethora of algorithms
from computer science.

The assembly langauge, while similar to Forth, uses special Unicode
characters to represent its words instead of multi-character strings.
We take inspiration from **APL** for doing calculations and **SQL**
for manipulating table data. What is particularly nice is that all
assembly language can be read and understood by any normal programmer.

The entire operating system is stored as a **GIT** respository so it's
always possible to see what has changed and to be able to revert to
a previous version using a special debug mode.

Documentation for everything comes with the system and is marked-up
and typeset with **TeX**. The display is updated with Postscript,
which fits in naturally with our Forth-like assembly language.

The natural document type is **Tome**, which is an isomorphic-to-**PDF**
format that uses the binary Cap'N Proto serialization format and
includes pre-typeset text for several popular screen sizes.

We will move the processing of **HTML**, **CSS**, and Javascript for
what are essentially static webpages to an agent running in *The
Cloud*. Our computer's agent will transform documents into the **TOME**
format and while in some cases it will introduce latency to a lookup,
our agent will also aggressively prefetch and cache documents.

## (Local) Latency

The latency of local effects such as scrolling, tapping, and swiping
are prioritized over everything else.

## Power Efficiency

The second priority is power efficiency.
