title: Rebol Source Overview
---

There's no good explaination of Rebol so I guess I'll have to figure
out the codebase myself. At the top level there are six
subdirectories:

* boot
* core
* include
* mezz
* os - Includes host-main.c is where the environment starts.
* tools - A dozen rebol files for compiling
