title: Proposal 3 â€” A Narrative
---

I want to start keeping track of my expenses so I think I'll create
something like a spreadsheet. I was reading
[this thread](http:fake.com) on the forums which I'd like to refer to
later. 

What I want in a spreadsheet is the ability to see exactly how much
money my life is costing me each day and how much income I have or
debt I'm going into. Putting it at this scale will really bring it
down to something that I can understand and relate to.

My daily expenses are made up of fixed expenses like rent and ad hoc
expenses like going to the grocery store.

    daily <- (Date, Fixed, Ad hoc) x days in 2018
