title: Proposal 2 â€” A Language
---

Here I propose a language by way of a garden path by describing Forth
(as I learn it for real), and **APL**, **LISP**, **REBOL**, Smalltalk,
and other cool languages that aren't quite as mainstream as I'm used
to.

## Forth

Forth is an interesting language because it's both low level and high
level at the same time. It's mind bending that a system that can serve
as an assembly language can also be used for **AI** research. I love
seeing examples of people starting off with a Forth prompt on a
computer with nothing else, not even an operating system, and building
a usable system from it.

I'm also sure that nostalgia has something to do with my interest in
it. I started programming in the 1980s and Forth, as far as I
remember, had a reputation of being the hacker's language. When I
think of Forth I think of a black/green **CRT** with a blinking cursor
in a dark room. 

I think also the whole `nip/tuck` constrained puzzle nature of the
language is intriguing to me.
