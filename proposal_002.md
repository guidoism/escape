title: Proposal 2 â€” A Language
---

Here I propose a language by way of a garden path by describing Forth
(as I learn it for real), and **APL**, **LISP**, **REBOL**, Smalltalk,
and other cool languages that aren't quite as mainstream as I'm used
to.

## Forth

Forth is an interesting language because it's both low level and high
level at the same time. It's mind bending that a system that can serve
as an assembly language can also be used for **AI** research. I love
seeing examples of people starting off with a Forth prompt on a
computer with nothing else and building a usable system from it.
