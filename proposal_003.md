title: Proposal 3 â€” A Soft Gooey Center
---

The heart of a computer should be friendly and playful -- A place for experimentation.
A place with no thorns!

One should have something like a REPL and Browser to dive into tables, objects, and stuff.
Everything should start from here. Only after I'm happy with something I've done will I commit it.
I can't accidentally ruin my good state in my soft gooey center -- That should give me
the confidence to experiment. If I screw up my display or input I should always be able to get back
to a known good state. This should be hard-wired with a dedicated button.
