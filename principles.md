1. Reading code over writing code. Optimize for new readers. Organize for the (new) reader, not for the compiler. [Kartik Agaram's Mu](https://github.com/akkartik/mu), Knuth's Literate Programming
2. Make use of tools like Git to encode and present changes as they happen logically, not necessarily how they were originally commited by the original programmer. (find the guy who is writing a c compiler that uses git in a novel way)

XXX? Threading, continuations, coroutines, generators vs C-style stack
