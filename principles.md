1. Reading code over writing code. Optimize for new readers. Organize for the (new) reader, not for the compiler. [Kartik Agaram's Mu](https://github.com/akkartik/mu), Knuth's Literate Programming
2. Make use of tools like Git to encode and present changes as they happen logically, not necessarily how they were originally commited by the original programmer. [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc)

XXX? Threading, continuations, coroutines, generators vs C-style stack
