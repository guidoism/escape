## Emulate Display

It will be helpful to get a terminal-like interface up and running early.
Since I clearly won't be able to make the kind of hardware I want I will
instead emulate the display on an existing system. The seperation of
the computationally intensive modern web rendering and a simplified on-device
protocol will be helpful to use on existing devices for the time being too!
