We write this with the aid of context to subsume excrutiating detail.
We don't need variables because we have context

    show message summaries as vertical list, reverse chronological
    a message summary shows from name, date sent, one line summary
    a tap on the message summary brings up the conversation
    the conversation is between me and 1 or more other people
    it's shows a vertical list of messages between me and all of those other people
    messages from me are blue and those from others are gray

* TODO: define show as vertical list
* TODO: define tap
* TODO: more specific layout for message summary (maybe using unicde control characters)
